## Security Best Practices

When using this tool:

1. **Never commit Azure credentials** to version control
2. **Use managed identities** when running in Azure environments
3. **Limit subscription access** to only what's needed
4. **Review exported files** before sharing — they contain subscription IDs and region data
5. **Don't run untrusted scripts** — always review code before execution

## Scope

This tool:
- ✅ Reads Azure PaaS service availability information (read-only)
- ✅ Reads quota/usage information (read-only)
- ✅ Reads retail pricing via public API (read-only)
- ❌ Does NOT create, modify, or delete any Azure resources
- ❌ Does NOT store or transmit credentials
- ❌ Does NOT access sensitive data beyond service availability and quota info
